 <h4>NEWS</h4><hr>
        <div id="news">
            <p>Sri Chaitanya School academic director Seema on Saturday said 75 students from AP, 38 students from Karnataka, 25 students from Telangana and 17 from TN were selected for the scholarship..</p>
            <p>Sri Chaitanya has the best staff for IT JEE preparation. They know how to handle their pupils and how to teach them. Whenever they inquire, they are happy to support their students. They concentrate on every single student. They know what the students will think well. I was completely stratified with the study materials they give to the students. And my teachers come forward during this lockout to assist the students through live classes and pre-recorded sessions. His professorship is one of the key reasons for his performance.</p>
